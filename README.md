## Movies API

The goal of this project is to create an API where the user can get information about movies, production companies, production countries and spoken languages.

This project uses:
- Java 8, Spring Boot 2.6.6;
- Jwt for security;
- Swagger for documentation;
- JSON in Java and HttpURLConnection to consume data from the MovieDB API;
- Lombok for faster development and a cleaner code;
- Hibernate, JPA and PostgreSQL for data storage;
- And more...
